# Handoff Document: Step 2 - Backend Initialization

This document outlines the steps taken to initialize the Python Falcon backend application, the current status of the project, and the issues encountered.

## Summary

The goal of this step was to set up and run a basic "Hello World" Falcon application as instructed in "Step 1 - Backend Initialization.md". The project structure has been created, dependencies have been installed, and the initial code has been written. However, the application is not yet running successfully.

## What has been done

1.  **Project Scaffolding**:
    *   The project directory `financial_dashboard_project` was created.
    *   A Python virtual environment was set up in `.venv`.
    *   A `requirements.txt` file was created with `falcon` and `gunicorn` as dependencies.
    *   The application directory structure (`app`, `app/models`, etc.) was created.

2.  **Dependency Installation**:
    *   All dependencies from `requirements.txt` were installed into the virtual environment.

3.  **Initial Application Code**:
    *   A basic Falcon application was created in `financial_dashboard_project/app/app.py` that should return a "Hello World" message.

## Current Status & Issues

The primary issue is that the Falcon application is not accessible, even though the Gunicorn process appears to be running.

Here is a timeline of the debugging steps taken:

1.  **Initial Run Attempt**: The first attempt to run the server failed due to a port conflict on port 8000.
2.  **Port Conflict Resolution**: The process using port 8000 was identified and terminated.
3.  **Background Server Failure**: The server was started as a background process, but `curl` requests to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` failed to connect.
4.  **Foreground Debugging**: To diagnose the issue, I attempted to run the Gunicorn server in the foreground to view its logs.
5.  **Execution Errors**:
    *   My first attempt to run the server in the foreground failed due to an error about the working directory not being a "registered workspace".
    *   My second attempt, which involved changing the directory before executing the run command, was cancelled by the user.

## Next Steps

The immediate next step is to successfully run the Gunicorn server in the foreground to inspect its output for errors. This will likely reveal why the application is not responding to requests.

The command that was cancelled was:
```bash
cd financial_dashboard_project && source .venv/bin/activate && gunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 app.app:app
```

Running this command should be the next action to move forward with debugging.
